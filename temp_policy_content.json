Specifically, the final rules allow \nintegrating HRAs and other account- \nbased group health plans with \nindividual health insurance coverage or \nMedicare, if certain conditions are \nsatisfied (an individual coverage HRA). \nThe final rules also set forth conditions \nunder which certain HRAs and other \naccount-based group health plans will \nbe recognized as limited excepted \nbenefits. Also, the Department of the \nTreasury (Treasury Department) and the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) are \nfinalizing rules regarding premium tax \ncredit (PTC) eligibility for individuals \noffered an individual coverage HRA. In \naddition, the Department of Labor (DOL) \nis finalizing a clarification to provide \nassurance that the individual health \ninsurance coverage for which premiums \nare reimbursed by an individual \ncoverage HRA or a qualified small \nemployer health reimbursement \narrangement (QSEHRA) does not \nbecome part of an ERISA plan, provided \ncertain safe harbor conditions are \nsatisfied. Finally, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) is \nfinalizing provisions to provide a \nspecial enrollment period (SEP) in the \nindividual market for individuals who \nnewly gain access to an individual \ncoverage HRA or who are newly \nprovided a QSEHRA. The goal of the \nfinal rules is to expand the flexibility \nand use of HRAs and other account- \nbased group health plans to provide \nmore Americans with additional options \nto obtain quality, affordable healthcare. \nThe final rules affect employees and \ntheir family members; employers, \nemployee organizations, and other plan \nsponsors; group health plans; health \ninsurance issuers; and purchasers of \nindividual health insurance coverage. \nDATES: \nEffective date: These final rules are \neffective on August 19, 2019. \nApplicability dates: The final rules \ngenerally apply for plan years beginning \non or after January 1, 2020. However, \nthe final rules under Code section 36B \napply for taxable years beginning on or \nafter January 1, 2020, and the final rules \nproviding a new special enrollment \nperiod in the individual market apply \nJanuary 1, 2020.

Background \nA. Executive Order \nOn October 12, 2017, President \nTrump issued Executive Order 13813,1 \n\u2018\u2018Promoting Healthcare Choice and \nCompetition Across the United States,\u2019\u2019 \nstating, in part, that the \u2018\u2018Administration \nwill prioritize three areas for \nimprovement in the near term: \nassociation health plans (AHPs), short- \nterm, limited-duration insurance \n(STLDI), and health reimbursement \narrangements (HRAs).\u2019\u2019 With regard to \nHRAs, the Executive Order directs the \nSecretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and \nHHS to \u2018\u2018consider proposing regulations \nor revising guidance, to the extent \npermitted by law and supported by \nsound policy, to increase the usability of \nHRAs, to expand employers\u2019 ability to \noffer HRAs to their employees, and to \nallow HRAs to be used in conjunction \nwith nongroup coverage.\u2019\u2019 The \nExecutive Order further provides that \nexpanding \u2018\u2018the flexibility and use of \nHRAs would provide many Americans, \nincluding employees who work at small \nbusinesses, with more options for \nfinancing their healthcare.\u2019\u2019 \nB. HRAs and Other Account-Based \nGroup Health Plans \n1. In General \nAn account-based group health plan \nis an employer-provided group health \nplan that provides for reimbursement of \nexpenses for medical care (as defined \nunder Code section 213(d)) (medical \ncare expenses), subject to a maximum \nfixed-dollar amount of reimbursements \nfor a period (for example, a calendar \nyear). An HRA is a type of account- \nbased group health plan funded solely \nby employer contributions (with no \nsalary reduction contributions or other \ncontributions by employees) that \nreimburses an employee solely for \nmedical care expenses incurred by the \nemployee, or the employee\u2019s spouse, \ndependents, and children who, as of the \nend of the taxable year, have not \nattained age 27, up to a maximum dollar \namount for a coverage period.2 The \nreimbursements under these types of \narrangements are excludable from the \nemployee\u2019s income and wages for \nfederal income tax and employment tax \npurposes. Amounts that remain in the \nHRA at the end of the year often may \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:08 Jun 19, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\20JNR2.SGM 20JNR2jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2\n28889 Federal Register / Vol. 84, No. 119 / Thursday, June 20, 2019 / Rules and Regulations \n3 For more information about employer payment \nplans, see IRS Notice 2013\u201354, Q&A\u20131 and Q&A\u2013 \n3, and IRS Notice 2015\u201317, Q&A\u20134 and Q&A\u20135, \n2015\u201314 IRB 845. \n4 For simplicity, the preamble generally refers \nonly to HRAs, but references to HRAs should also \nbe considered to include other account-based group \nhealth plans as defined in the final rules, unless \notherwise specified. This term does not include \nQSEHRAs, under Code section 9831(d); medical \nsavings accounts (MSAs), under Code section 220; \nor health savings accounts (HSAs), under Code \nsection 223. In addition, for purposes of the final \nrules, the term \u2018\u2018HRA or other account-based group \nhealth plan\u2019\u2019 does not include an employer \narrangement that reimburses the cost of individual \nhealth insurance coverage through a cafeteria plan \nunder Code section 125 (cafeteria plan premium \narrangements); however see later in this preamble \nfor a clarification that plan sponsors may offer such \nan arrangement in addition to an individual \ncoverage HRA. A QSEHRA is not a group health \nplan for purposes of the market requirements of the \nCode (except as provided in Code section \n4980I(f)(4)), parts 6 and 7 of ERISA, and titles XXII \nand XXVII of the PHS Act, and is not included in \nthe definition of HRAs and other account-based \ngroup health plans for purposes of the final rules \nor this preamble. A QSEHRA is, however, \nconsidered a group health plan under the PHS Act \nfor purposes of part C of title XI of the Social \nSecurity Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d et seq.). See PHS Act \nsection 2791(a)(1), as amended by the 21st Century \nCures Act (Cures Act), Public Law 114\u2013255, section \n18001(c). \n5 While the PPACA amendments to PHS Act \nsection 2722(b) and (c) (formerly PHS Act section \n2721(c) and (d)) could be read as restricting the \nexemption for excepted benefits so it applies only \nwith respect to subpart 2 of part A of title XXVII \nof the PHS Act, HHS does not intend to use its \nresources to enforce the market requirements with \nrespect to excepted benefits offered by non-federal \ngovernmental plan sponsors and encourages states \nto adopt a similar approach with respect to issuers \nof excepted benefits. See 75 FR 34537, 34539\u201334540 \n(June 17, 2010). \n6 While the PPACA amendments to title XXVII of \nthe PHS Act removed the parallel provision at \nsection 2722(a) (formerly PHS Act section 2721(a)), \nHHS follows a similar approach for retiree-only \nnon-federal governmental plans and encourages \nstates to adopt a similar approach with respect to \nhealth insurance issuers of retiree-only plans. See \n75 FR 34537, 34539\u201334540 (June 17, 2010). \n7 PHS Act section 2711 applies to grandfathered \nhealth plans, except that the annual dollar limit \nprohibition does not apply to grandfathered \nindividual health insurance coverage. \nGrandfathered health plans are health plans that \nwere in existence as of March 23, 2010, and that \nare only subject to certain provisions of PPACA, as \nlong as they maintain status as grandfathered health \nplans under the applicable rules. See 26 CFR \n54.9815\u20131251, 29 CFR 2590.715\u20131251, and 45 CFR \n147.140. \n8 For information regarding EHBs, see HHS\u2019s \nFebruary 25, 2013 final rules addressing EHBs \nunder PPACA section 1302 (78 FR 12834 (Feb. 25, \n2013)); see also HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment \nParameters for 2016 (80 FR 10871 (Feb. 27, 2015)). \nIn addition, HHS issued final rules providing states \nwith additional flexibility to define EHBs, starting \nwith plan years beginning on or after January 1, \n2020. See 45 CFR 156.111 (83 FR 16930 (April 17, \n2018)). The current rules under PHS Act section \n2711 include a definition of EHBs that applies for \nplans that are not required to cover EHBs. See 26 \nCFR 54.9815\u20132711(c), 29 CFR 2590.715\u20132711(c), \nand 45 CFR 147.126(c). As explained later in this \npreamble, the rules set forth in this document \ninclude amendments to the definition of EHBs \nunder the PHS Act section 2711 rules to reflect the \nupdated final EHB rules. \n9 As explained in prior guidance, the Departments \nof Labor, the Treasury and HHS (the Departments) \nhave determined that the annual dollar limit \nprohibition is not applicable to certain account- \nbased group health plans that are subject to other \nstatutory provisions limiting the benefits available \nunder those plans. See 80 FR 72192, 72201 (Nov. \n18, 2015). Specifically, the Departments have \nexplained that the annual dollar limit prohibition \ndoes not apply to health FSAs that are offered \nthrough a cafeteria plan under Code section 125 \n(cafeteria plan) because PPACA section 9005 \nspecifically limits salary reduction contributions to \nhealth FSAs to $2,500 (indexed for inflation) per \nyear. Notwithstanding this exclusion for certain \nhealth FSAs from the application of the annual \ndollar limit prohibition, rules under Code section \n125 provide that health FSAs are not permitted to \nreimburse employees for premiums for health \ninsurance coverage. See Code section 125(d)(2)(A) \nand proposed 26 CFR 1.125\u20135(k)(4) (72 FR 43938, \n43959 (Aug. 6, 2007)). Similarly, although MSAs \nand HSAs generally are not treated as group health \nplans subject to the market requirements, the \nDepartments have concluded that the annual dollar \nlimit prohibition would not apply to an MSA or \nHSA even if a particular arrangement did satisfy the \ncriteria to be a group health plan because both types \nof arrangements are subject to specific statutory \nprovisions that limit the contributions. See 75 FR \n37188, 37190 (June 28, 2010); see also IRS Notice \n2004\u20132, Q&A\u20131 and Q&A\u20133, 2004\u20132 IRB 269, \nwhich defines an HSA as a tax-exempt trust or \ncustodial account and a high-deductible health plan \nas a health plan; see also DOL Field Assistance \nBulletin No. 2004\u201301, available at https://\nwww.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/employers-and- \nadvisers/guidance/field-assistance-bulletins/2004- \n01 and DOL Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2006\u201302, \nContinued \nbe used to reimburse medical care \nexpenses incurred in later years, \ndepending on the terms of the HRA. \nHRAs are not the only type of \naccount-based group health plan. For \nexample, an employer payment plan is \nalso an account-based group health \nplan. An employer payment plan is an \narrangement under which an employer \nreimburses an employee for some or all \nof the premium expenses incurred for \nindividual health insurance coverage, or \nother non-employer sponsored hospital \nor medical insurance. This includes a \nreimbursement arrangement described \nin Revenue Ruling 61\u2013146, 1961\u20132 CB \n25, or an arrangement under which the \nemployer uses its funds directly to pay \nthe premium for individual health \ninsurance coverage or other non- \nemployer sponsored hospital or medical \ninsurance covering the employee.3 \nOther examples of account-based group \nhealth plans include health flexible \nspending arrangements (health FSAs) \nand certain other employer-provided \nmedical reimbursement plans that are \nnot HRAs.4 \n2. Application of the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act to HRAs and \nOther Account-Based Group Health \nPlans \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, Public Law 111\u2013148, was \nenacted on March 23, 2010 and the \nHealth Care and Education \nReconciliation Act of 2010, Public Law \n111\u2013152, was enacted on March 30, \n2010 (collectively, PPACA). PPACA \nreorganized, amended, and added to the \nprovisions of part A of title XXVII of the \nPHS Act relating to health coverage \nrequirements for group health plans and \nhealth insurance issuers in the group \nand individual markets. The term \n\u2018\u2018group health plan\u2019\u2019 includes both \ninsured and self-insured group health \nplans. \nPPACA also added section 715 to \nERISA and section 9815 to the Code to \nincorporate the provisions of part A of \ntitle XXVII of the PHS Act, PHS Act \nsections 2701 through 2728 (the market \nrequirements), into ERISA and the Code, \nmaking them applicable to group health \nplans and health insurance issuers \nproviding health insurance coverage in \nconnection with group health plans. In \naccordance with Code section 9831(b) \nand (c), ERISA section 732(b) and (c), \nand PHS Act sections 2722(b) and (c) \nand 2763, the market requirements do \nnot apply to a group health plan or a \nhealth insurance issuer in the group or \nindividual market in relation to the \nprovision of excepted benefits described \nin Code section 9832(c), ERISA section \n733(c), and PHS Act section 2791(c).5 \nSee the discussion later in this preamble \nfor additional background on excepted \nbenefits. In addition, in accordance with \nCode section 9831(a)(2) and ERISA \nsection 732(a), the market requirements \ndo not apply to a group health plan that \nhas fewer than two participants who are \ncurrent employees on the first day of the \nplan year.6 \nPHS Act section 2711, as added by \nPPACA, generally prohibits group \nhealth plans and health insurance \nissuers offering group or individual \nhealth insurance coverage7 from \nestablishing for any individual any \nlifetime or annual limits on the dollar \nvalue of essential health benefits \n(EHBs), as defined in PPACA section \n1302(b). PHS Act section 2711, \nhowever, does not prevent a group \nhealth plan, or a health insurance issuer \noffering group or individual health \ninsurance coverage, from placing an \nannual or lifetime dollar limit for any \nindividual on specific covered benefits \nthat are not EHBs, to the extent these \nlimits are otherwise permitted under \napplicable law.8 \nHRAs are subject to PHS Act section \n2711. An HRA generally will fail to \ncomply with PHS Act section 2711 \nbecause the arrangement is a group \nhealth plan that imposes an annual \ndollar limit on EHBs that the HRA will \nreimburse for an individual.9 \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:08 Jun 19, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\20JNR2.SGM 20JNR2jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2\n28890 Federal Register / Vol. 84, No. 119 / Thursday, June 20, 2019 / Rules and Regulations \navailable at https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/ \nemployers-and-advisers/guidance/field-assistance- \nbulletins/2006-02, which provide guidance \nregarding HSAs not constituting \u2018\u2018employee welfare \nbenefit plans\u2019\u2019 covered by ERISA Title I where \nemployer involvement with the HSA is limited. \nTherefore, the final rules do not apply to MSAs, \nHSAs, or, in certain circumstances, health FSAs. \n10 See also 26 CFR 54.9815\u20132713, 29 CFR \n2590.715\u20132713, and 45 CFR 147.130. \n11 Because MSAs and HSAs generally are not \ntreated as group health plans, these arrangements \nare not subject to PHS Act section 2713.

In IRS Notice \n2015\u201387, Q&A\u20132, however, the Departments \nclarified that an HRA that includes terms permitting \nthe purchase of individual health insurance \ncoverage, even if reimbursement is only allowed \nafter the employee ceases to be covered by other \nintegrated group health plan coverage, fails to be \nintegrated with other group health plan coverage \nand therefore fails to comply with PHS Act sections \n2711 and 2713. \n17 See 80 FR 72192 (Nov. 18, 2015). \n18 See FAQs about Affordable Care Act \nImplementation (Part XXII), available at https://\nwww.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/ \nour-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-xxii.pdf \nor https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact- \nSheets-and-FAQs/Downloads/FAQs-Part-XXII- \nFINAL.pdf. \n19 The Treasury Department and the IRS note that \nthe information included in this preamble is not \nintended to be guidance regarding the proper \nfederal tax treatment or consequences of any \nparticular arrangement, except to the extent the \npreamble addresses the application of Code sections \n36B, 9801, 9802, 9815, 9831, and 9832 and PHS Act \nsections 2711 and 2713. \nPHS Act section 2713, as added by \nPPACA, generally requires non- \ngrandfathered group health plans, and \nhealth insurance issuers offering non- \ngrandfathered group or individual \nhealth insurance coverage, to provide \ncoverage for certain preventive services \nwithout imposing any cost-sharing \nrequirements for these services.10 Non- \ngrandfathered HRAs are subject to and \nfail to comply with PHS Act section \n2713 because, while HRAs may be used \nto reimburse the costs of preventive \nservices, HRAs do not reimburse such \ncosts after the HRAs have reimbursed \nthe maximum dollar amount for a \ncoverage period, and therefore HRAs fail \nto provide the required coverage, and \nviolate the prohibition on imposing cost \nsharing for preventive services.11 \n3. Prior Rules and Guidance on \nIntegration of HRAs and Other Account- \nBased Group Health Plans \nThe Departments previously issued \nrules and subregulatory guidance \nregarding the application of PHS Act \nsections 2711 and 2713 to HRAs.12 The \nrules and guidance generally provide \nthat, if an HRA is \u2018\u2018integrated\u2019\u2019 with \nother group health plan coverage that \ncomplies with PHS Act sections 2711 \nand 2713, the HRA is considered to be \nin compliance with those sections \nbecause the combined arrangement \ncomplies with them. The rules and \nguidance also provide that HRAs may be \nintegrated with Medicare and TRICARE \ncoverage if certain conditions are \nsatisfied, but may not be integrated with \nindividual health insurance coverage for \npurposes of complying with PHS Act \nsections 2711 and 2713.13 \nMore specifically, in the preamble to \nthe 2010 interim final rules under PHS \nAct section 2711, the Departments \nprovided that HRAs may be integrated \nwith \u2018\u2018other coverage as part of a group \nhealth plan\u2019\u2019 that complies with PHS \nAct section 2711 in order for the HRAs \nto be considered to satisfy PHS Act \nsection 2711.14 The interim final rules \ndid not, however, set forth rules for \nimplementing integration; the \nintegration methods were set forth in \nlater subregulatory guidance and \nsubsequently included in the final rules \nunder PHS Act section 2711 issued in \n2015. \nOn September 13, 2013, the Treasury \nDepartment and the IRS issued Notice \n2013\u201354, the DOL issued Technical \nRelease 2013\u201303, and HHS issued \ncontemporaneous guidance explaining \nthat HHS concurred with the DOL and \nTreasury Department guidance.15 This \nguidance stated that an HRA may not be \nintegrated with individual health \ninsurance coverage for purposes of PHS \nAct sections 2711 and 2713, but \ndescribed methods for integrating an \nHRA with another group health plan.16 \nThe Departments later incorporated the \nprovisions of this guidance into the final \nrules issued in 2015 under PHS Act \nsection 271117, which are summarized \nlater in this section of the preamble. \nOn November 6, 2014, the \nDepartments issued FAQs about \nAffordable Care Act Implementation \n(Part XXII).18 Q&A\u20131 reiterated and \nclarified prior subregulatory guidance \nby explaining that if an employer offers \nits employees cash to reimburse the \npurchase of individual health insurance \ncoverage, the payment arrangement is a \ngroup health plan, without regard to \nwhether the employer treats the money \nas a pre-tax or post-tax benefit to the \nemployee, and it may not be integrated \nwith individual health insurance \ncoverage, and, therefore, will fail to \ncomply with PHS Act sections 2711 and \n2713.19 \nOn February 18, 2015, the Treasury \nDepartment and the IRS issued Notice \n2015\u201317. Q&A\u20133 provided that an \narrangement under which an employer \nreimburses (or pays directly) some or all \nof the medical care expenses for \nemployees covered by TRICARE \nconstitutes an HRA and may not be \nintegrated with TRICARE to comply \nwith PHS Act sections 2711 and 2713 \nbecause TRICARE is not a group health \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 18:08 Jun 19, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\20JNR2.SGM 20JNR2jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2", "summary": "Points of agreement between the analyses:\n- Both OpenAI and Claude identified the relevant excerpt from the document that discusses state innovation waivers from HHS and the Treasury Department.\n- Both models highlighted the key requirements for states seeking approval for a state innovation waiver, such as providing access to comprehensive and affordable healthcare coverage, covering a comparable number of residents, and not increasing the federal deficit.\n- Both models mentioned the evaluation", "analysis": "This analysis was generated using an ensemble of OpenAI, Claude models in response to the query: 'How can state exchanges benefit from the policy?'.", "timestamp": "2025-04-12 16:11:58"}, "ensemble:Individual Coverage HRAs - Policy + HC.gov Application Overview_FINAL 8.28.2020.pdf": {"type": "ensemble", "content": "Fall 2020\nIndividual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements: Policy and Application Overview\nAgenda\nI.

Background.  Lawyers and law firms that engage in activities detrimental to critical American interests should not have access to our Nation\u2019s secrets, nor should their conduct be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.  My Administration must also take appropriate and necessary measures to guard against the actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that arise when the Government funds, engages with, or otherwise devotes resources to law firms and their clients that engage in conduct undermining critical American interests and priorities.\nI have determined that action is necessary to address the significant risks, egregious conduct, and conflicts of interest associated with Susman Godfrey LLP (Susman).  Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.  Susman also funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of political and radical ideology, and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race.\nSusman itself engages in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of race.  For example, Susman administers a program where it offers financial awards and employment opportunities only to \u201cstudents of color.\u201d My Administration is committed to ending such unlawful discrimination perpetrated in the name of \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d policies and ensuring that Federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, including those laws and policies promoting our national security and respecting the democratic process.  Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our Nation\u2019s secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of any Federal funds.\n\nSec. 2.  Security Clearance Review.  (a)  The Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall immediately take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Susman, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. \n(b)  The Office of Management and Budget shall identify all Government goods, property, material, and services, including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, provided for the benefit of Susman.  The heads of agencies providing such material or services shall, to the extent permitted by law, expeditiously cease such provision. \n\nSec. 3.  Contracting.  (a)  To prevent the transfer of taxpayer dollars to Federal contractors whose earnings subsidize, among other things, activities that are not aligned with American interests, including racial discrimination, Government contracting agencies shall, to the extent permissible by law, require Government contractors to disclose any business they do with Susman and whether that business is related to the subject of the Government contract. \n(b)  The heads of agencies shall review all contracts with Susman or with entities that disclose doing business with Susman under subsection (a) of this section.  To the extent permitted by law, the heads of agencies shall:\n(i)   take appropriate steps to terminate any contract, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation, for which Susman has been hired to perform any service; and\n(ii)  otherwise align their agency funding decisions with the interests of the citizens of the United States; with the goals and priorities of my Administration as expressed in executive actions, especially Executive Order 14147 of January 20, 2025 (Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government); and as heads of agencies deem appropriate.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget an assessment of contracts with Susman or with entities that do business with Susman effective as of the date of this order and any actions taken with respect to those contracts in accordance with this order. \n\nSec. 4.  Racial Discrimination.  Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the action authorized by section 4 of Executive Order 14230 of March 6, 2025 (Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP).  \n\nSec. 5.  Personnel.  (a)  The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide guidance limiting official access from Federal Government buildings to employees of Susman when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.  In addition, the heads of agencies shall provide guidance limiting Government employees acting in their official capacity from engaging with Susman employees to ensure consistency with the national security and other interests of the United States.\n(b)  Agency officials shall, to the extent permitted by law, refrain from hiring employees of Susman, absent a waiver from the head of the agency, made in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, that such hire will not threaten the national security of the United States. \n\nSec. 6.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\n    April 9, 2025.", "summary": "Points of agreement between the analyses:\n- Both analyses agree that the policy document is focused on ending unlawful discrimination, specifically based on race, by an organization called Susman.\n- They both highlight that the policy aims to ensure federal benefits support the laws and policies of the United States, aligning agency funding decisions with the interests of U.S. citizens and the goals of the current administration.\n- Both analyses mention that federal agencies are directed to asse", "analysis": "This analysis was generated using an ensemble of OpenAI, Claude models in response to the query: 'Tell me what this policy is about.'.", "timestamp": "2025-04-12 16:25:32"}}
